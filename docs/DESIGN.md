# Design decisions and dead ends

Broader architectural narrative that doesn't fit `docs/cli-trust.md`'s CLI-output-trust theme —
why things are shaped the way they are, and paths considered and rejected. Like `cli-trust.md`,
this is a record of reasoning, not a spec: when the black box it's reasoning about changes (a new
Obsidian version, a new podman release), the conclusions here may need resampling. What should
stay true regardless is the general ethos this repo follows — verify everything through an
explicitly recognizable path, log every step, fail hard on the unknown.

## Podman network identity: pinning the same IP/MAC across reconnects

`isolate.ts`'s `nodeAddress()` derives a fixed IP and MAC address per node (`n1` → `10.89.0.101`
/ `6e:62:6e:65:74:65`, etc.) and re-applies it on every reconnect, rather than letting podman
assign a fresh one each time. The theory: Sync recognizing "the same device, unchanged" on
reconnect may behave differently (faster, or just more representative of a real device blip) than
a genuinely new join would look like — a real laptop reconnecting to wifi keeps its identity, so
the harness's simulated disconnect should too.

The MAC address's first byte is `0x6e` ('n', for "nbnet") rather than the more on-the-nose `0x6f`
('o', for "obnet") for a real constraint, not a spelling preference: a MAC address's first byte's
least-significant bit is the I/G (individual/group) bit — 0 for a normal unicast address, 1 for
multicast — and `0x6f` has that bit set. Podman's rootless network backend (netavark) refuses to
assign a multicast address to a real interface, confirmed live (`Error: netavark: create veth
pair: Netlink error: Cannot assign requested address`) before switching to `0x6e`, which also has
the U/L (locally-administered) bit set — correct for a made-up, non-vendor-assigned address. Only
the first byte carries this constraint; the rest of the address is free to be anything (subject to
staying valid hex, since the last byte encodes the node number and must stay a 2-hex-digit value).

## The local node (`L`): a grammar token, not a parallel code path

Adding a real Obsidian instance running directly on the host as a harness participant could have
meant threading a separate `localDriver` parameter through every function that iterates `drivers`
— `driverOf`, `waitNodesSynced`, the final settle, the oracle. Instead, `L` is a DSL-grammar-level
token, but it resolves to an ordinary position in the *same* `drivers` array (always pushed last)
the instant `execute.ts` processes the op — so everything downstream treats it exactly like any
other node, with zero special-casing. The grammar-level distinction exists for exactly one reason:
the local instance must never be disconnected (no safe network-isolation primitive exists for the
user's own physical machine — see below), and that invariant is easiest to guarantee by making it
structurally inexpressible in the DSL (`dsl.ts`'s `assertLocalAlwaysConnected`), backed by a
second, independent runtime assert in `execute.ts` in case the grammar-level guarantee is ever
bypassed.

**Rejected alternative: reuse node number `0` for the local instance instead of a new token.**
`dsl.ts`'s `dropRedundantNodes` already uses `active = 0` as a sentinel meaning "nothing selected
yet" — a real node `0` would collide with that sentinel, silently dropping the very first `N0`
selection in any history. This is exactly the kind of thing worth writing down here rather than
rediscovering by hitting the bug again: the collision isn't obvious from reading
`dropRedundantNodes` in isolation, only from knowing the historical reason `0` was chosen as the
sentinel in the first place.

## Real network isolation for the local node: rejected for now, not forever

Every other fault primitive in this harness (`D`/`C`) works by detaching a *container* from its
podman network — safe, because the blast radius of a mistake is a disposable container. The local
node is the user's real physical machine, so the same primitive isn't available, and the
alternatives considered so far all have real problems (framed around macOS, since that's the host
this has actually been run on so far):

- **macOS's Application Firewall (`socketfilterfw`)** — the wrong tool entirely, not just a
  slower one: it only gates *incoming* connections, and Obsidian Sync is a client-initiated
  outbound WebSocket connection (`wss://sync-xx.obsidian.md`) — blocking incoming connections to
  Obsidian does nothing to the traffic that actually needs blocking.
- **`pfctl`** — could actually work (it operates on outbound traffic), but a botched or
  interrupted rule change is host-global, not scoped to one process — unlike a podman container,
  there's no "just delete it" undo, and a stuck rule from a hard crash (not a clean exit) could
  affect the user's real networking, not just Obsidian. A narrowly-scoped anchor (blocking only
  `sync-*.obsidian.md` traffic, not a broad default-deny) plus a session-scoped sudoers grant
  (set up/torn down per soak, not a standing grant) meaningfully narrows this risk — worth
  revisiting as a real feature later, but it reverses this round's "local instance always
  connected" premise, so it needs its own design pass, not a bolt-on.
- **A macOS sandbox** (`sandbox-exec`) to run Obsidian without network access, then restart it
  outside the sandbox — process-scoped (no shared host state to leak, unlike `pfctl`), but
  Apple-deprecated with no public docs, and restarting the whole app to move it in/out of the
  sandbox is a much coarser action than a real network blip; it's unclear Sync would even treat
  an app restart as "the same device reconnecting" rather than something else, and it only gives
  one offline window per restart — doesn't compose with a `barrier`/`paced` history doing several
  D/C cycles per rep.
- **A disposable macOS VM (`tart`, Cirrus Labs)** — runs real macOS on Apple Silicon through the
  same `Virtualization.framework` the podman machine already uses for the Linux containers,
  container-like in workflow (`tart clone`/`tart run`). This removes the actual objection to
  network isolation (risk to the user's *physical* host, not a fundamental objection to isolating
  the local instance at all) — the blast radius of a mistake becomes the disposable VM, not the
  real laptop.
  Provisioning looked harder than it turned out to be: an Obsidian developer's own forum comment
  says Sync credentials live in IndexedDB inside the app's own appdata folder, not the OS
  Keychain — meaning a fresh VM likely just needs that folder copied in, not an interactive
  re-login or a Keychain export/import dance, much closer to how the container image already
  bakes in a logged-in state. Still a real, separate undertaking (its own VM lifecycle to build),
  but the biggest assumed blocker turned out not to be one.

For now: no network fault primitive for the local node at all. It's a real, always-connected
participant — `assertLocalSyncOn` (`execute.ts`) checks its Sync state before every op it
performs; a host-internet blip gets a chance to recover first (see the settle loop's own
host-outage handling), but a genuinely off Sync state aborts the whole run (not just the rep),
since it invalidates every subsequent rep until a human notices and fixes it.
